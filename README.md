# Classification with Playground Series - S4E7
**Kaggle Playground July 2024** - Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling

[About the July Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7)

**Goal:** The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer.

**Evaluation:** Submissions are evaluated using area under the ROC curve using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.

**Learning:** This is my first time applying auto machine learning (Neural Network) with **LightAutoML**. I learned how to process data for this specific tool and how to config my model to optimize it. I also work on ensembling multiple outputs from other Gradient Boosting Algorithms to improve performance.
